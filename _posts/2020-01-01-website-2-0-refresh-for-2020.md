#### Re: First Contact - Site Background

I've decided to focus my first post on this new site refresh. You likely haven't seen the previous version of this website but there's a copy of an image above and a copy of the entire site at: [https://jasonwai.netlify.com](https://jasonwai.netlify.com "https://jasonwai.netlify.com"). It was getting tired and I let it fall by the wayside as life and work got in the way. Here's to 2020 and version 2.0.

Often, when I visit a website or blog, I like to think about what stack or technology it's built on. In addition, I wonder about the design and whether or not the site is created by the same author of the articles.  In a nutshell, I look for information on the creation, design, and development piece. This post is for all of you who are curious about my site.

I'm using a site generator ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll")) with a base theme ([Reked](https://github.com/artemsheludko/reked "Reked")) to create this. There are a lot of flavours of statics site generators out there. You can have a look at [https://www.staticgen.com/](https://www.staticgen.com/ "https://www.staticgen.com/") for a better idea on language and templates being used. Although I designed and created my previous site, I've decided to use an open-sourced theme that was created and designed by [Artem Sheludko](http://artemsheludko.com/ "Artem Shelduko website"). The design is clean and suits my needs of wanting to focus on content. I made a few tweaks to the base design but it's essentially a copy of the original.

One cool thing I'm trying as well is [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/ "Stackbit") which really helps with automating deployments and building out everything I need pretty effortlessly. It really simplifies the integrations to get a JAMStack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) website going! For more on JAMstack, see [https://jamstack.org/](https://jamstack.org/ "https://jamstack.org/"). Again, the point here is to focus on content.
