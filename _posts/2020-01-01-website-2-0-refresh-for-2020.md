#### Re: First Contact - Site Background

I've decided to focus my first post on this new site refresh. You likely haven't seen the previous version of this website but there's a copy of an image above and I've decided to keep a copy of the entire site at: LINK. It was getting old and I let it slide to the wayside as life and work got in the way. Here's to 2020 and version 2.0 with a full site refresh.

A lot of times, when I visit a person's website or blog, I like to think about what stack or technology it's built on. In addition, I wonder about the design, whether it's created by the same author of the articles and the owner of the site. If it isn't created by the author and if I like the design, then where can I get a copy to play with. Essentially the creation, design, and development piece.

I used a site generator ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll")) with a base theme to create this. There are a lot of flavours of statics site generators out there and you should have a look at [https://www.staticgen.com/](https://www.staticgen.com/ "https://www.staticgen.com/") for a better idea on language and templates being used. Although my previous site was more custom built by me for me, I've decided to use something that was created and designed by [**_Artem Sheludko_**](http://artemsheludko.com/ "Artem Shelduko website"). This design is clean and suits my needs of wanting to focus on content. I made a few tweaks to the base design but it's essentially a copy of the original.

One cool thing I'm trying as well is [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/ "Stackbit") which really helps with automating deployments and building out everything I need pretty effortlessly. It really simplifies the integrations to get a JAMStack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) website going!
