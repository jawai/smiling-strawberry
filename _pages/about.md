Hi, I'm Jason, a lawyer with an engineering background and a passion for all things privacy.

As a privacy professional, I advise and collaborate with internal and external stakeholders to support organizations with their privacy needs. I ensure organizations are compliant with privacy legislation and regulations at the federal and provincial level, and with organizations' internal privacy program and policies. I identify privacy risks and help create solutions to enable organizations to leverage the value of data while protecting the privacy rights of individuals. In addition, I help to ensure organizations' use of data is ethical and consistent with its values.
